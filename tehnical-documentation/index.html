                        JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</li>
                            <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.</li>
                        </ul>

                        To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first 
                        "Hello world" JavaScript code:
                       <code>
                           <button id="btn-copy"><i class="fa fa-copy"></i></button>
                            function greetMe(yourName) { <br>("Hello " + yourName); <br>}<br>
                            greetMe("World");
                        </code>
                        Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!
